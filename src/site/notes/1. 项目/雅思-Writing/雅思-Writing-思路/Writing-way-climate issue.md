Q:
Some people think that climate change has a negative impact on businesses, while others believe that it provides more business opportunities. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
A:
With the ~~devolopment~~ development of human activities, more people pay their attention to the climate change  how to infulencing the businesses. Some people believe that the change of climate is a good opportunity for business, however others point out that it damage the business.
对于一些公司而言，气候变化会有更多的机会，例如一些咨询公司，MBB，他们会提供ESG咨询，一个关于 可持续 绿色经济的咨询，这个会让他们公司的有更多的业务，也就会有更多的收入
但是对于另外一些公司而言，特别是tranditional industry companies,like coal fuel and oil, 各国政府已经开始征收 carbon-tax , 他们在经验的过程中要承担更重的tax和成本，对于他们而言 气候变化 让他们更难做生意
From my perspective, the climate change is a good challenge for the inovation companies. Morden people focus on the climate issue. If any companies could settle the issue or do something the can make environment better than before etc. Tesla, Alibaba and more.  ~~The sales of them will dramatic grow.~~ ==The sales of them will grow dramatically.==
The climate change is the challenge to every company. But some companies will change the challenge to the opportunity.
